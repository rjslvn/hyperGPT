# GPT-3 Highlight Assistant

This Python script allows you to highlight text, press a hotkey, and then get a response from OpenAI's GPT-3 model. The response is copied to your clipboard and also displayed in a GUI window.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* You have installed the necessary Python libraries: `os`, `keyboard`, `pyperclip`, `time`, `requests`, `openai`, and `tkinter`.
* You have an OpenAI API key. You can get one by signing up on the [OpenAI website](https://www.openai.com/).

## Using GPT-3 Highlight Assistant

To use the script, follow these steps:

1. Replace `"YOUR API KEY HERE"` in the script with your actual OpenAI API key.
2. Run the script.
3. Highlight any text you want to send to GPT-3.
4. Press the `win+alt+c` hotkey.
5. The script will send the highlighted text to GPT-3 and display the response in a GUI window. The response will also be copied to your clipboard.
